# Machine-Learning-NLP-Prep

python review prior to machine learning and natural language processing workshop

## Overview

This repository contains workbooks and links used during the "python background and preparation" workshop held at the UCSF Library on Dec 3, 2019. 

This workshop was designed to provide a review of python programming skills and techniques that will be used extensively in the machine learning and natural language processing workshops on Dec 10 and Dec 17. This workshop also provides a greater focus on file I/O and string/text manipulation in preparation for document classification in the NLP workshop.

## Data

This workshop uses data from the Cornell Movie Review dataset http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/

This workshop will use the polarity dataset v1.1 http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/mix20_rand700_tokens_0211.tar.gz

To run the workbooks below, download and unzip the polarity dataset, and move the "mix20_rand700_tokens_0211" folder into the directory containing the two jupyter notebooks.
